## UTAH Coding Bootcamp React Project

---

### Overview

The Clicky Game uses React.js to offer a very dynamic website that update specific changes done in real time, which makes the updates occur faster giving a very interactive experience to the User. 
This Application has been deployed in git-hub pages. 

In this project I used JSX to build Funtional or Class components, and CSS to Style. I used the create react app tool as well to set the react structure.
